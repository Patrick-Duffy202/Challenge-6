For challenge 6, we are tasked with the development of a weather tracking app. This app will provide users the ability to search for their chosen city and will be provided with the current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index, as well as an icon depicting the current conditions outside (sunny, cloudy, rain etc.). In addition to this information, users will also receive a 5 day weather forecast for their chosen city. This app is designed with the traveler in mind, as it provides a simple, no frills layout of the current weather and 5 day forecast for any city they choose. 

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
